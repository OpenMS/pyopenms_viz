Peak Map
========

Peak Maps can be plotted using kind = peakmap. Commonly in this plot, mass-to-charge is on the x-axis, retention time is on the y-axis and intensity is on the z-axis (or represented by color). The x and y axis can be changed based on use case, for example y can also be ion mobility. Using `plot_3d=True` enables 3D plotting. Currently 3D plotting only supported for `ms_matplotlib` and `ms_plotly` backends.
