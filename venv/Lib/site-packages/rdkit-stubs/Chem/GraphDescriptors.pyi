     A topological index meant to quantify "complexity" of molecules.
    
         Consists of a sum of two terms, one representing the complexity
         of the bonding, the other representing the complexity of the
         distribution of heteroatoms.
    
         From S. H. Bertz, J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol 103, 3599-3601 (1981)
    
         "cutoff" is an integer value used to limit the computational
         expense.  A cutoff value tells the program to consider vertices
         topologically identical if their distance vectors (sets of
         distances to all other vertices) are equal out to the "cutoff"th
         nearest-neighbor.
    
         **NOTE**  The original implementation had the following comment:
             > this implementation treats aromatic rings as the
             > corresponding Kekule structure with alternating bonds,
             > for purposes of counting "connections".
           Upon further thought, this is the WRONG thing to do.  It
            results in the possibility of a molecule giving two different
            CT values depending on the kekulization.  For example, in the
            old implementation, these two SMILES:
               CC2=CN=C1C3=C(C(C)=C(C=N3)C)C=CC1=C2C
               CC3=CN=C2C1=NC=C(C)C(C)=C1C=CC2=C3C
            which correspond to differentk kekule forms, yield different
            values.
           The new implementation uses consistent (aromatic) bond orders
            for aromatic bonds.
    
           THIS MEANS THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.
    
           Any molecule containing aromatic rings will yield different
           values with this implementation.  The new behavior is the correct
           one, so we're going to live with the breakage.
    
         **NOTE** this barfs if the molecule contains a second (or
           nth) fragment that is one atom.
