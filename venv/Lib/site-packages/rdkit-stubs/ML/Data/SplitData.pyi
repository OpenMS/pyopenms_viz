    """
      "splits" a data set held in a DB by returning lists of ids
    
      **Arguments**:
    
        - conn: a DbConnect object
    
        - frac: the split fraction. This can optionally be specified as a
          sequence with a different fraction for each activity value.
    
        - table,fields,where,join: (optional) SQL query parameters
    
        - useActs: (optional) toggles splitting based on activities
          (ensuring that a given fraction of each activity class ends
          up in the hold-out set)
          Defaults to 0
    
        - nActs: (optional) number of possible activity values, only
          used if _useActs_ is nonzero
          Defaults to 2
    
        - actCol: (optional) name of the activity column
          Defaults to use the last column returned by the query
    
        - actBounds: (optional) sequence of activity bounds
          (for cases where the activity isn't quantized in the db)
          Defaults to an empty sequence
    
        - silent: controls the amount of visual noise produced.
    
      **Usage**:
    
      Set up the db connection, the simple tables we're using have actives with even
      ids and inactives with odd ids:
      >>> from rdkit.ML.Data import DataUtils
      >>> from rdkit.Dbase.DbConnection import DbConnect
      >>> from rdkit import RDConfig
      >>> conn = DbConnect(RDConfig.RDTestDatabase)
    
      Pull a set of points from a simple table... take 33% of all points:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> train,test = SplitDbData(conn,1./3.,'basic_2class')
      >>> [str(x) for x in train]
      ['id-7', 'id-6', 'id-2', 'id-8']
    
      ...take 50% of actives and 50% of inactives:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> train,test = SplitDbData(conn,.5,'basic_2class',useActs=1)
      >>> [str(x) for x in train]
      ['id-5', 'id-3', 'id-1', 'id-4', 'id-10', 'id-8']
    
    
      Notice how the results came out sorted by activity
    
      We can be asymmetrical: take 33% of actives and 50% of inactives:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> train,test = SplitDbData(conn,[.5,1./3.],'basic_2class',useActs=1)
      >>> [str(x) for x in train]
      ['id-5', 'id-3', 'id-1', 'id-4', 'id-10']
    
      And we can pull from tables with non-quantized activities by providing
      activity quantization bounds:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> train,test = SplitDbData(conn,.5,'float_2class',useActs=1,actBounds=[1.0])
      >>> [str(x) for x in train]
      ['id-5', 'id-3', 'id-1', 'id-4', 'id-10', 'id-8']

def SplitIndices(nPts, frac, silent = 1, legacy = 0, replacement = 0):
    """
     splits a set of indices into a data set into 2 pieces
    
        **Arguments**
    
         - nPts: the total number of points
    
         - frac: the fraction of the data to be put in the first data set
    
         - silent: (optional) toggles display of stats
    
         - legacy: (optional) use the legacy splitting approach
    
         - replacement: (optional) use selection with replacement
    
       **Returns**
    
         a 2-tuple containing the two sets of indices.
    
       **Notes**
    
         - the _legacy_ splitting approach uses randomly-generated floats
           and compares them to _frac_.  This is provided for
           backwards-compatibility reasons.
    
         - the default splitting approach uses a random permutation of
           indices which is split into two parts.
    
         - selection with replacement can generate duplicates.
    
    
      **Usage**:
    
      We'll start with a set of indices and pick from them using
      the three different approaches:
      >>> from rdkit.ML.Data import DataUtils
    
      The base approach always returns the same number of compounds in
      each set and has no duplicates:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5)
      >>> test
      [1, 5, 6, 4, 2]
      >>> train
      [3, 0, 7, 8, 9]
    
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5)
      >>> test
      [5, 2, 9, 8, 7]
      >>> train
      [6, 0, 3, 1, 4]
    
    
      The legacy approach can return varying numbers, but still has no
      duplicates.  Note the indices come back ordered:
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5,legacy=1)
      >>> test
      [3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
      >>> train
      [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
    
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5,legacy=1)
      >>> test
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
      >>> train
      [4, 6, 7]
    
      The replacement approach returns a fixed number in the training set,
      a variable number in the test set and can contain duplicates in the
      training set.
      >>> DataUtils.InitRandomNumbers((23,42))
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5,replacement=1)
      >>> test
      [9, 9, 8, 0, 5]
      >>> train
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
      >>> test,train = SplitIndices(10,.5,replacement=1)
      >>> test
      [4, 5, 1, 1, 4]
      >>> train
      [0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]
