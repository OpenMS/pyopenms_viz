     Calculates the informational entropy of a set of results.
    
      **Arguments**
    
        results is a 1D Numeric array containing the number of times a
        given set hits each possible result.
        For example, if a function has 3 possible results, and the
          variable in question hits them 5, 6 and 1 times each,
          results would be [5,6,1]

def PyInfoGain(varMat):
    """
     calculates the information gain for a variable
    
        **Arguments**
    
          varMat is a Numeric array with the number of possible occurrences
            of each result for reach possible value of the given variable.
    
          So, for a variable which adopts 4 possible values and a result which
            has 3 possible values, varMat would be 4x3
    
        **Returns**
    
          The expected information gain
