    a class for storing clusters/data
    
          **General Remarks**
    
           - It is assumed that the bottom of any cluster hierarchy tree is composed of
             the individual data points which were clustered.
    
           - Clusters objects store the following pieces of data, most are
              accessible via standard Setters/Getters:
    
             - Children: *Not Settable*, the list of children.  You can add children
               with the _AddChild()_ and _AddChildren()_ methods.
    
               **Note** this can be of arbitrary length,
               but the current algorithms I have only produce trees with two children
               per cluster
    
             - Metric: the metric for this cluster (i.e. how far apart its children are)
    
             - Index: the order in which this cluster was generated
    
             - Points: *Not Settable*, the list of original points in this cluster
                  (calculated recursively from the children)
    
             - PointsPositions: *Not Settable*, the list of positions of the original
                points in this cluster (calculated recursively from the children)
    
             - Position: the location of the cluster **Note** for a cluster this
               probably means the location of the average of all the Points which are
               its children.
    
             - Data: a data field.  This is used with the original points to store their
               data value (i.e. the value we're using to classify)
    
             - Name: the name of this cluster
