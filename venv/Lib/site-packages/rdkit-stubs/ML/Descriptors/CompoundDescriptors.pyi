     used for calculating descriptors
    
       This is the central point for descriptor calculation
    
       **Notes**
    
       - There are two kinds of descriptors this cares about:
    
          1) *Simple Descriptors* can be calculated solely using atomic descriptor
             values and the composition of the compound.  The full list of possible
             simple descriptors is determined by the types of *Calculator Methods*
             (see below) and the contents of an atomic database.
    
             Simple Descriptors can be marked as *nonZeroDescriptors*.  These are used
             to winnow out atom types where particular atomic descriptors are zero
             (usually indicating that the value is unknown)
    
             Simple Descriptors are maintained locally in the _simpleList_
    
          2) *Compound Descriptors* may rely upon more complicated computation schemes
             and descriptors for the compound as a whole (e.g. structural variables, etc.).
             The full list of compound descriptors is limitless.  They are calculated using
             the _ML.Descriptors.Parser_ module.
    
             Compound Descriptors are maintained locally in the _compoundList_
    
       - This class has a some special methods which are labelled as *Calculator Method*
         These are used internally to take atomic descriptors and reduce them to a single
         simple descriptor value for a composition.  They are primarily intended for internal use.
    
       - a *composition vector* is a list of 2-tuples: '[(atom1name,atom1Num),...]'
         where atom1Num is the contribution of the atom to the stoichiometry of the
         compound. No assumption is made about the stoichiometries (i.e. they don't
         have to be either integral or all sum to one).
