PDFgen is a library to generate PDF files containing text and graphics.  It is the
foundation for a complete reporting solution in Python.  It is also the
foundation for piddlePDF, the PDF back end for PIDDLE.

Documentation is a little slim right now; run then look at testpdfgen.py
to get a clue.

Progress Reports:
0.82, 1999-10-27, AR:
        Fixed some bugs on printing to Postscript.  Added 'Text Object'
        analogous to Path Object to control entry and exit from text mode.
        Much simpler clipping API.  All verified to export Postscript and
        redistill.
        One limitation still - clipping to text paths is fine in Acrobat
        but not in Postscript (any level)

0.81,1999-10-13, AR:
        Adding RoundRect; changed all format strings to use %0.2f instead of %s,
        so we don't get exponentials in the output.
0.8,1999-10-07, AR:  all changed!

2000-02-07: changed all %0.2f's to %0.4f in order to allow precise ploting of graphs that
        range between 0 and 1 -cwl
